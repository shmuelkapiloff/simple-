# simple-

A fresh repository ready to build a small "simple shop" project.

## What do you want to build?

Pick one of these starting points (reply with your choice and I’ll scaffold it here):

1) Static site (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS)
- Simple product list, basic cart (localStorage), no backend
- Easiest to start, deploy anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)

2) Full-stack JavaScript (Node + Express API + React UI)
- REST API for products/cart; React frontend (Vite)
- Good balance of flexibility and simplicity

3) Python backend (Flask or FastAPI) + simple frontend
- Lightweight backend with templates or a small JS SPA

If you prefer a different stack (Next.js, Django, Svelte, etc.), say the word.

## Suggested next steps

- Confirm your preferred stack (1, 2, or 3 above)
- I’ll auto-generate the project structure, add minimal code, and wire up basic commands
- We’ll run a quick smoke test to verify everything works locally on Windows

## Optional: local prerequisites

- For JavaScript stacks: Node.js LTS
- For Python stacks: Python 3.10+

## Notes

- This repo currently only contains this README and a .gitignore. Once you pick a stack, the codebase will be scaffolded accordingly.
